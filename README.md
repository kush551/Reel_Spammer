<h1>Warning</h1>

This software is created solely for educational purposes and has only been tested with my own Instagram accounts. If you choose to use it, do not employ it to disturb anyone. If you decide to use it with your friends, ensure that it's done in a controlled and light-hearted manner, and obtain their consent beforehand.

<h2>Update</h2>

Please note that this software is still a work in progress; there are a few bugs that I am actively working to resolve.

<h3>How to Use Without Encountering Errors</h3>

After running the program and logging into your Instagram account, wait until the first reel has been sent before adjusting your mouse cursor slightly and then leaving it. If the loop isn't functioning properly, try switching between your IDE or terminal and the Chrome window.

Any issues will be addressed as time permits. I would greatly appreciate if someone could assist in resolving them.
